To get the probability prediction of test_data, three files need to be executed:

1. Execute structureLearning.m, by typing command in Octave: structureLearning(26,15,1)

2. Execute structureLearning2.m, by typing command in Octave: structureLearning2(26)

3. Execute paraEstmate.m, by typing command in Octave: paraEstimate

Finally, a file named probs.mat will be produced
